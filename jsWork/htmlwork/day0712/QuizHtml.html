        It's like walking through the sky<br>
        Where the stars come and go<br>
        It's the light within my reach<br>
        Not as distant as it seemed<br>
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Dreams are moments<br>
        Night is long<br>
        Yet we linger in the past<br>
        Tell me, do you feel the same?<br>
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        I can take you far, far away<br>
        Far enough for us to disappear<br>
        Should you feel a little scared<br>
        Know that I'm still right here<br>
        It will be a little bittersweet<br>
        It might even feel a bit surreal<br>
        Just see the stars run past you as you<br>
        Drift apart in air<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Like the leaves riding on the autumn breeze<br>
        Like the days gone too far for us to seize<br>
        We move on and leave it as it is, but once in a while<br>
        Let the reminiscence brighten this melody<br>
    </p>
